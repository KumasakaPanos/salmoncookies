    <h2>The Story</h2>
    
    <p1><img src='images/fishT.png' id='fisht' width='40px' height='30px'>he story of the salmon cookies began 150-odd years ago. Great Grandma Sal and her husband, Great Grandpa Saul, were preparing the Christmas feast. Their contribution, a plate of seared salmon and a batch of cookies were already running late when their dear dog knocked Saul off balance and he dropped a fillet in the mixing bowl. Sal was mixing so fast she didn't notice and the wayward fish was positively blended in with the dough. Saul wisely chose to avoid informing his wife of his accident and their dishes went in the oven. Come dinner, the cookies were a huge hit but the only one who knew why kept his mouth shut. Or at least he did until the rest of the family was out of earshot. Granny took it upon herself to perfect the recipe and thus a tradition was born; a tradition which can now be enjoyed by you and your family.</p1>
